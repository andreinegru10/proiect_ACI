no longer in any doubt of our ability to deal heavy
blows at the very heart of his strength. Berlin,
Essen, Nuremberg, Munich and other German cities are
having to endure heavier attacks from the air than
the Germans have inflicted upon Warsaw, Rotterdam,
Belgrade and London.

We know how great is your sacrifice, how
bitter your agony. But we know too that you will
endure to the end. Already the Axis are on the
defensive. Every day, by land, sea and air, the
Forces of Freedom grow stronger. They are united
in that struggle for Freedom which is also yours.
They will not pause in their efforts till victory
is won.
