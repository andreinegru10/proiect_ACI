Ever since then I have been mentally exploring the extraordinary
possibilities which this recording technique has in our wartime
situation as well as afterward. You have my profound admiration
for having conceived the idea and having spurred me - and no doubt
other folklore people - to try it out. It opens up a field which
has not before been touched by the radio, and a field of enormous
importance to Americans. It heightens their consciousness of
themselves as Americans, and it contributes vitally to civilian
morale in expressing what the common people of the nation are
feeling and thinking, and expression of others than governmental
leaders, radio commentators, and newsmen.
