To all British people your message is an
inspiration to ever increasing effort against the
enemy. We have followed with grief and horror the
long martyrdom which the Polish nation has suffered
at the hands of the German oppressors. We have watched
with admiration the courageous resistance which your
people have opposed that tyranny. We are determined
that by our effort and that of our Allies the evil
forces which have caused your suffering shall be for
ever destroyed. To that end are striving the soldiers,
sailors and airmen, the land workers and the factory
workers of all the United Nations.
