We know how great is your sacrifice, how
bitter your agony. But we know too that you will
endure to the end. Already the Axis are on the
defensive. Every day, by land, sea and air, the
Forces of Freedom grow stronger. They are united
in that struggle for Freedom which is also yours.
They will not pause in their efforts till victory
is won.
