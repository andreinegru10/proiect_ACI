2. There are several disadvantages to Guam as a base. First and
most fundamental is that upon the arrival of the 58th Wing the existing
facilities and facilities now under construction for the operation of
B-29 aircraft from Guam will be completely absorbed. An airfiled from
which the 509th Group could operate would not be ready until August.
There is an acute shortage of construction personnel on Guam because of
the tremendous construction program now underway there. Shipping to and
from Guam is steadily increasing and exceeding the availability of load-
ing and unloading facilities in the harbor and it can be expected that
such a congestion would hamper and delay the shipping of all material of
the 509th Group. Inevitably the establishment of the special equipment
for production of the unit on Guam would entail clearing of jungle areas
and the building in the jungle of many roads not now proposed for the
island development.
