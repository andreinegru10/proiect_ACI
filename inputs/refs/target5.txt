10 Downing Street, 
Whitehall, S.W.1.

13 July, 1944

My dear Henry,

You wrote to me on 1 July about the German plans for the
massacre of the Hungarian Jews.

I have forwarded your letter to the Foreign Secretary and
fear that I can add nothing to the statement he made in the House on
5 July in replying to Silvermanâ€™s Question.

There is no doubt in my mind that we are in the presence of
one of the greatest and most horrible crimes ever committed. It has
been done by scientific machinery by nominally civilized men in the name
of a great state and one of the leading races of Europe. I need not
assure you that the situation has received and will receive the most
earnest consideration from my colleagues and myself but, as the
Foreign Secretary said, the principal hope of terminating it must remain
the speedy victory of the Allied Nations.

Yours sincerely,

(sd) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL

The Lord Melchett.
