To send a force of Allied bombers to destroy the death
camps at Treblinka and Majdanek. Those camps have been built
and fitted specially for mass executions (gas and steam
chambers in whcih several thousand people can be killed daily),
it would take the Germans several months to rebuild them,
during which period many thousands human beings could be
saved.
