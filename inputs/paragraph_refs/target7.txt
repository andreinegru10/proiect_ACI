The Library of Congress has a large collection of recordings
of folk songs and speech of the people of the United States
about contemporary problems. Out of this collection of material,
mostly recorded since December 7, we are making an electrical
transcription called, "Dear Mr. President", in which the people
discuss democracy, their local community and the United States
at war and address themselves directly to the President of the
United States.
