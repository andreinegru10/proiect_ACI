1. During the period from 8 February to 21 February 1945 an inspec-
tion tour of the islands of Guam and Tinian was made by Commander F. L.
Ashworth, USN, during which information was gathered upon which a decision
as to the ultimate operating base of the 509th Composite Group could be
based. Prior to this inspection tour it had been proposed to base the
Group of Guam. The AAF Headquarters in the forward area have recommended
Tinian as the base. In view of the results of the tour of inspection, it
has been decided that Tinian is the most desirable island on which to base
the 509th Compound Group.
