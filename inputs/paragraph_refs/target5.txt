My own plans need to be set by the first of the year, and i have
several in embryo now. But by far the most appealing and important
possibility is with the recording technique which you and I tried
last Monday. Even if the returns from other folklorists were not
much, I am certain that the two disks I cut are alone sufficient
proof that we must go on with a widespread and down-to-earth project
of this sort for the duration of the war. I have solid friendships
with several Washington people whose support of such a project would
probably assure it. You have too, I know, I'm merely suggesting
a coalition of forces, with confidence that such as Mrs. Roosevelt
and Charles Seeger will be interested in the project and in any
connection I may have with it.
