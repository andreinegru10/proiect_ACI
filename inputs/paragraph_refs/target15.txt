The island of Tinian is 125 miles north of Guam and approximately
1450 miles southeast of Tokyo. It is about 10 miles long and 3 miles wide,
and has a gently rolling terrain. Prior to our occupation, approximately
95% of its area was planted in sugar cane. Tinian has two major airfields,
North Field and West Field, the larger being North Field with four 8500 foot
landing strips directed into the prevailing easterly winds. West Field will
have two 8500 foot landing strips also directed east and west. Harbour
facilities capable of berthing 8 cargo vessels of the Liberty Ship type
are now under construction to be completed around 15 March. An excellent
network of black-topped coral base roads will connect all major installa-
tions on the island.
