News has been given on the wireless tonight about the
mass murderers carried out by the Germans in the district of
Lublin in Poland. At the death camps of Majdanek and
Treblinka of hundreds of thousands of human beings who,
no matter how valiant, are today absolutely unable to defend
themselves or to put up any effective resistance. This means
that Hitler is pursuing his policy of extermination of the
Polish nation, a policy which he has so far carried out with
appalling results and unpunished.
