Immediate retaliation. I know, this is a method equally
strange to the British nation as to any decent minded people,
but it is the sole and only one the Germans can and will
understand. If they were told that hundred of their villages
will be razed to the ground by the Allied bombers, unless mass
murderers in Poland or in any other occupied country, are
stopped, they would stop. And if they were made to pay with
the blood of their own civilians for the crimes they have
commited. they would not commit them agian. We know that the
culprits will be punished when the Allied Nations have won
this war, but by that time they will have murdered thousands
and thousands more of their victims whose lives could still be
saved, if the Germans were made to pay for their crimes now.
