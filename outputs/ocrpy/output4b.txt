that s Leader of the Unitedd Nationa, you will be in a poaition
to act imnediately in order to save those people. They are the
future soldiers, ready and only waitin; for weapons to take up
fighting. When the time oomes, they will prove themiaelves among
the best Allied soldiera. But if the death camps at Treblinka
and MaaJdanek are allowed to continue their work of mass *
alaughter, those soldiers will all be killed by the Germana
before they even had a chance to fight.
Por the Polish Tation their death, the death of thousands
enfl thousanda people, will constitute a calamity from which it
will take it a very long time to recover. This is why I hsve
taken the liberty of writin t o you, 8ir, in hope and all'
earnestness, that you will help us.
I have the honour, etcc,
(Sgd.) Auoyna H.' Tomassewska. (Miss).
