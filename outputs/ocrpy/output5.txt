Ky dear Henry,
10 Downing Street,
Whitehall, %,.l.
13 Jw34, 184
ou wwrote to me on l JqlY about the German plans for the
massacre of the Iungarian Jews,
TI have forwarded your letter to the Foreign Secretary and
fear that TI can add nothing to the statement he made in the House on
5 July in replying to Silverman's guestion.
TThere is no doubt in my mind that we are in the presence of
cne of the greatest and most horrible orimes ever comitted. It has
been dcne by aoientifio machinery by nominally civilized men in the name
of a great state and one of the le ading racea of Europe. I need not
assure you that the situaticn has received an will receive the most
earnest consideration from my colleagues and myself but, as the
Poreign Secretary said, the principal hope of terminating it must remain
the speedy viotory of the Allie3 Natias.
The Lord Melchett.
Yours sinoerely,
