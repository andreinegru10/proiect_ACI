blows at the very heart of his strength. Berlin,
Essen, Euremberg, EEunich and other Gersssn eities are
having to endure heavier attacks frcm the air than
the Germans have inflicted ugon Yarsaw, Eottercam,
Belgrade and London.
Ee knos bow great is your sacrifiee, how
bitter yeur agon3. But se kno teo that you will
endure to the end. Already the Axis are on the

They will not gause in their efforts till victorg
