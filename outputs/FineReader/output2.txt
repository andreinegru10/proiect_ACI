the Library of Congress hss a large collection of recordings of folk songs and speech of the people of the United States about contemporary problems. Out of this collection of material, mostly recorded since December 7, we are making an electrical transcription called, ^eer Mr. ^resident®, in which the people discuss democracy, their local community and the United States at war and address themselves directly to the President of the United States.
The Office of Emergency Management is producing this program and distributing it free to local radio stations and schools so that the people of Imerica may hear it.
In connection with this educational project, we should like your permission to include part of the recording of ttThis World Can,t Do Me Wo Harm® in this educational broadcast prepared by the Library of Congress. Only a short fragment will be used as cue music.
I would deem it a great favor to the Library of Congress^if you whuld be so kind as to give us this permission. An addressed, franked envelope is enclosed for your reply.
Sincerely yours,
Alan Lomax
Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
