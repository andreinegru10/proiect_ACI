Dear Alan:;
I hope earnestly that the two disks I shipped you by air express Monday night reached you safely and quickly.
Ever since then I have been mentally exploring the extraordinary possibilities trhich this recording techniaue has in our wartime situation as well as afterward. You have my profound admiration for having conceived the idea and having spurred me - and no doubt other folklore people - to try it out. It opens up a field which has not before been touched by the radio, and a field of enormous importance to Americans. It heightens their consciousness of themselves as Americans, and it contributes vitally to civilian morale in expressing what the common people of the nation are feeling and thinking, anc expression of others than governmental leaders, radio commentators, and newsmen.
By this time of the week I am so certain of its continued usefulness that I want very much to have a continuing and developing part in it. Surely it is being continued, isn’t it? And on what basis?
Whatever the basis, potential or actual, I want to talk with you about it. I can come to Washington anytime after December l^th for that purpose.
My own plans need to be set by the first of the year, and I have several in embryo now. But by far the mosfc appealing and important possibility is with the recording technique which you and I tried last Monday. Even if the returns from other folklorists were not much, I am certain that the two disks I cut are alone sufficient proof that we must go on with a widespread and down-to-earth project of this sort for the duration of the war. I have solid friendships with several Washington people whose support of such a project would probably assure it. You have too, I know. I’m merely suggesting a coalition of forces, with confidence that such as Mrs. Roosevelt and Charles Seeger will be interested in the project and in any connection I may have with it.
This, you must understand, is no attempt to muscle in on something you have started, but entirely an earnest desire to be of service to the wartime project which I can most wholeheartedly and efficiently put myself into.
