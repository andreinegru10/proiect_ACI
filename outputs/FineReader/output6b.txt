no longer in any doubt of our ability to deal heavy blows at the very heart of his strength. Berlin, Essen, Nuremberg, Munich and other German cities are having to endure heavier attacks from the air than the Germans have inflicted upon Far saw, Rotterdam, Belgrade and London.
We know tew great is your sacrifice, how bitter your agony. But re know too that you will endure to the end. Already the Axis are on the defensive. Pvery day, by land, sea -and air, the Forces of Freedom grow stronger. They are united in that struggle for Freedom which is also yours. They will not pause in their efforts till victory is won.
